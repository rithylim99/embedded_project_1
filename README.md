# Multi-Sensor Monitoring with ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS

## Description

This project demonstrates the use of **ESP-IDF** and **FreeRTOS** for multitasking and sensor management on an ESP32 microcontroller. It integrates three sensors **BMP280 (temperature sensor)**, **KY-003 (magnetic sensor)**, and an **ADC-based soil moisture sensor** to monitor environmental conditions and log data efficiently. Each sensor operates as an independent FreeRTOS task, showcasing real-time multitasking in resource-constrained environments.

## Features

- **BMP280 Temperature Monitoring**  
   Reads temperature data using the BMP280 sensor via I2C, calibrates raw sensor data, and logs temperature in Â°C.

- **KY-003 Magnetic Field Detection**  
   Detects the presence or absence of a magnetic field and logs the state.

- **Soil Moisture Level Monitoring**  
   Measures soil moisture using an ADC input and maps the raw ADC value to a percentage.

## Hardware Requirements

- **ESP32 Development Board**
- **BMP280 Sensor** (I2C connection)
- **KY-003 Magnetic Sensor**
- **Soil Moisture Sensor** (ADC input)
